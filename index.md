I am a computer science student at Cal State Fullerton and I am projected to graduate 2027

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 
* Lab 12.
    I was a fan of all parts of lab 12. We got to work with new types of code and I thought that 2 dimensional vectors were very interesting to learn about. I also thought that using them to create colors was very cool.

* Lab 7 Part 2.
    I liked lab 7 part to because i got to learn more about blackjack considering my uncles like to play that a lot when I go camping and now i can try to beat them. I also thought the coding of it was fun for the most part despite me having minor difficulties with  the beginning portion.

* Lab 1.
    I liked our first lab because it was the easiest for sure. But along with it being easy it was my first introduction to coding in general which I thought was very memorable which is why it is on my list. My partner for this was also a pretty cool guy.
